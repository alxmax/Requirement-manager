"""Plan drift: which planned items cite code that has moved on without
them.

The failure mode this answers was measured by a consumer over four
occasions: the code gets fixed, the note stays written. On 2026-09-05
fourteen of sixteen candidate items in one repo were already done; the
reader found out by opening each file by hand.

What is decidable from a plan file is narrow, and this module is
deliberate about the edge of it. A cited path that resolves nowhere is
a FACT. A file that changed after the note was written is a REASON TO
READ, not a verdict. And a fix that leaves the path, the symbol and the
line exactly where they were is invisible to any check of form - the
consumer's own words, after the case that taught it. A detector
claiming more than this would be worse than none, because it would
make the list look self-verifying.

The four false-positive classes below were each paid for in that
consumer's first run, not theorised here.
