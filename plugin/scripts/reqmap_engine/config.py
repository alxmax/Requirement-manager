# One band for the whole hierarchy was wrong in both directions: an architecture requirement
# groups detailed design, where a dozen children is ordinary, while a system need groups
# architecture, where ten is already a lot.
#
# The floor is gone because the corpus's own shape refutes it (ADR-0023 — read it before
# restoring one). Measured at b0ce92b over the `satisfies:` graph, the old uniform band
# produced 10 findings: 7 below the floor and 3 above the ceiling. The floor is
# anti-correlated with corpus quality — several of those 7 appeared *because* commits
# e254a34 and 72213fc folded away leaves that should not have existed, dropping their
# parents from 5 children to 4. A check that gets louder as the corpus gets better is
# measuring the wrong thing. In this corpus a child count is also a CLAUSE count, since the
# `satisfies:` children were derived roughly one per Description bullet, so the floor
# measures what `ac-count-high` already measures on the other axis. And the distribution
# has no floor to find: 3:1, 4:6, 5:5, 6:8, 7:5, 8:9 is continuous. ADR-0019 pre-committed
# the response: "the band is wrong for this shape of corpus and should be widened or
# dropped — not lived with."
#
# NOTE: an earlier version of this comment claimed "a blind review confirmed 0 of 9 as
# real". That figure was withdrawn — no commit ever produced 9 FLOOR findings (4, then 6,
# then 7 as the corpus changed), and the one flag it called plausibly real, ARCH-CHECK-006,
# is a CEILING finding. The floor rests on the distribution and the anti-correlation above,
# both of which reproduce from a sha and a filter.
#
# The ceiling stays: the distribution DOES break at 19 -> 22 -> 23 -> 32, and the single
# finding above it is ARCH-CHECK-006 at 32, which is real and left standing.
# Measured after this change: 1 finding over 72 lintable requirements.
# A parent with no `level:` keeps the uniform 5-20 band — the level axis stays doubly
# opt-in (ADR-0019), so a repo that never declares it sees exactly what it saw before, and
# this corpus's evidence is not silently imposed on a corpus shaped differently.
#
# `system`'s ceiling is ten again (ADR-0025 restores the 3-tier split ADR-0024 had
