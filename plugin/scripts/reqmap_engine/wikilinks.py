"""`RM036`: an `[[ID]]` in a Description that names no requirement.

A binding clause that reads `see [[REQ-X-012]]` hands its obligation to
another file. When that file is deleted the clause still reads as a
contract and the gate still passes: `depends_on:` and code tags were
checked, prose links never were. That is how a rejected split once
destroyed nine confirmed contracts with a green gate — the parents held
only pointers, and the children were deleted.

Narrow on purpose, so it fires on the broken link and nothing else: only
the Description is read (the normative text), inline code spans are
skipped (`[[ID]]` written as an example), and only an id-shaped target
counts, so a note like `[[child]]` is prose. Warn, like RM034: the link is
broken, the build is not.
