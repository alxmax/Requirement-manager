# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COMMANDS registry — single source of truth for the CLI command set.
# Each entry describes one user-facing command: its summary, the positional
# argument it accepts (or None), and the flags it owns (subset of the shared
# argparse flag pool; global flags --root/--reqs/--code/--cache are omitted).
# Later tasks will derive argparse choices, tool_definition.json, and a
# markdown command table from this registry — do NOT add behaviour here.
