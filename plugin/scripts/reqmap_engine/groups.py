# ---------- decompose on contract groups: the code rung for a tagged
# corpus ----------
# `init` mints the code rung only for files it extracts, and it extracts only
# untagged files; `clarify --levels` classifies a requirement but never
# creates one. So a corpus that adopted the tool at the architecture rung had
# no path to `level: code` at all — on one consumer, 40 of 42 architecture
# nodes with zero children and 160 group labels sitting in their contracts.
# This is the path. The seam is one the AUTHOR already drew: a bold group
# label in the Description is a heading the author wrote to say "these
# clauses belong together", and a behaviour group is what the code rung is
# defined as. It is not the engine inventing structure; it is the engine
# reading structure that is already in the file, which is the line ADR-0025
# had to refold 573 leaves back behind.

without it.

## Cases
{cases}

## Context
**Notes**
- SCAFFOLD, NOT A DECISION. The seam was the parent's own group label, not a \
guess, but
  whether this group is ONE behaviour or several is still yours to judge.
- No `implements:` tag was written. The gate checks that a tag exists, \
never that it
  points at the right code, so an auto-generated child citing the wrong \
function would
  pass every check. Expected members, found by searching for the group's \
subject —
  verify each, then tag by hand:
{members}
- {copied} case(s) copied here from {parent}; {unassigned} of the parent's \
cases went to no
  child because no group's subject appeared in their text, or more than one did.
- {parent} was not edited: its Description still holds this group's \
clauses, so deleting
  this file loses nothing. Once this child is confirmed, trimming the \
parent is yours to do.
