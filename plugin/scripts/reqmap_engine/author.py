## Description
> 1–3 plain sentences anyone can follow — what this is, why it exists, and what
> breaks without it. No jargon; this is the angle a non-expert reads first. The
> quote is rationale, not an obligation: it is not hashed and never trips drift.

Every bullet below is binding.
<!-- Audience: a developer new to this project. Six rules:
""" '     1. Name the subject: "`init` creates the folder", never "It '
'creates the folder".\n'
'     2. Present tense — no "shall", no "must". The line above already '
'binds every clause.\n'
"""\
     3. One binding statement per bullet, in at most three sentences; the extra
        sentences state the first's consequence, never a second obligation.
""" "     4. Define project-specific terms inline on first use; "
"programming terms need none.\n"
"""\
     5. Group clauses past five, with bold labels (see below).
""" "     6. Keep a clause to at most 3 sentences and 150 words — `lint` "
"enforces both.\n"
"     Scope: one capability = one behavior that fails independently. "
"Many clauses AND\n"
"""\
     many acceptance criteria together mean several capabilities — split them
     (`lint` flags this as 'over-scoped'). -->

**What it does**
""" "- `<subject>` does one thing, stated so a test could check it. No "
"function names; true\n"
"""\
  regardless of how the code is implemented.
""" "  <!-- Rationale: why this specific behavior, one clause, only when "
"not self-evident -->\n"
"""\

**What it produces**
- `<subject>` returns <output shape and allowed values>.
- `<subject>` handles a missing or invalid optional input by <behavior>.

## Verify intent (open questions for the human)
""" "- Observed: <a behavior that may be an AI accident — swallowed "
"error, empty-string\n"
"""\
  fallback, magic constant, unreachable branch>. Intended, or a bug to fix?

## Cases (= tests)
""" "<!-- Write at least one case from the CALLER's side, not the "
"implementation's: the\n"
"""\
     cases an author reaches for first vary the quality of one kind of input and
     never its kind. `clarify` names that shape (case-monoculture).
     Keep Given/When/Then concrete and self-explanatory; spell out any term the
     Description introduced. -->
CASE-1  <!-- verifiable by: automated test | manual | inspection | load test -->
  Given  <precondition>
  When   <action>
""" "  Then   <observable, pass/fail result>   (one test per case; each "
"maps to tested-by)\n"
"""\

## Context (non-binding)
""" "<!-- Everything here is commentary: not hashed, not linted, never "
"trips drift. On\n"
"""\
     any conflict with the Description + Cases above, they win. Bold sub-labels
     are the same clause-group convention the Description uses (ADR-0017) — keep
     only the ones you need. -->
**Notes**
""" "- A known fragility/footgun the implementer should know but which "
"is NOT enforced.\n"
"""\

**Example**
- e.g. Ana marks AUTH-001 confirmed, later edits its contract text; at commit
  `check` tells her "DRIFT — contract changed since lock" so she re-reviews.
