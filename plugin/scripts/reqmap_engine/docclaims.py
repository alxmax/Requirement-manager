"""`RM035`: a number a prose document states about the corpus, re-measured.

A document that says "236 requirements in total" is asserting something the
engine can count, and nothing was counting it. This repository's own `CLAUDE.md`
drifted to four wrong counts while every check passed — the failure the whole
tool exists to prevent, reproduced in the file every contributor reads first.

Opt-in by construction, in two independent ways: a repository whose documents
carry no `<!--reqmap:...-->` marker gets no finding, and `DOC_CLAIM_FILES` names
which documents are read at all. So a consumer repo that wants nothing here pays
one `os.path.join` and one failed `open`, and a consumer that wants it writes
one marker. Warn, never error: a stale sentence is a documentation defect, not a
broken link.
