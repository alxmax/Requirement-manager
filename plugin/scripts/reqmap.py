"""reqmap — requirement manager engine (stdlib only).

Subcommands:
  init              first-use bootstrap: scaffold requirements/ + .reqmapignore, draft
                    requirements from existing code, build the lock + map, print next steps
  new AREA-NAME-NNN   scaffold a requirement from the built-in template (--from-todo seeds from TODO.md)
  scan              list code members (implements/generated-from/... tags) per capability
  gate              the gate: link sync + drift + test-link integrity; exit non-zero on error (pre-commit/CI)
  sync              rescan + advance the drift baseline + regen the map (--accept-drift for an edited contract)
  map               generate requirements/_map.md (Mermaid) + _map.json (graph) [+ _map.html viewer]
  site              inject/refresh engine-owned regions into a presentation page (--attach/--regions/--diagram)
  export            emit the registry graph as requirements/_map.json (for a front-end)
  next              terminal 'what should I do next': counted, actionable risk buckets
  lint [--strict]   readability/structure check on non-draft requirements (warn; --strict fails on errors)
  show <ID>         consolidated dossier for one requirement (contract, deps, members, risk)
  dupes [--threshold T]  flag requirement pairs with overlapping contracts (TF-IDF cosine)
  health [--json]   corpus coherence score + component counts (--json for a CI badge)
  draft             draft requirements from legacy code (status: draft, risk-scored)
  plan              read-only JSON capability-extraction plan (writes no .md)
  findings          aggregate open verify-intent items into requirements/_findings.md
  confirm <ID>      flip a reviewed requirement's status to confirmed (one frontmatter edit)
  review [ID]       emit a JSON review plan (intent/contract/acceptance/anchors) for AI-assisted quality review
  check             DEPRECATED alias for `gate` (report) / `sync` (with --update-lock); removed next major

Layout on disk (relative to repo root, override with --root / --reqs / --code):

# Short name

> WHY: 1–3 plain sentences anyone can follow — what this is, why it exists, and
> what breaks without it. No jargon; this is the angle a non-expert reads first.

## WHAT — Contract (normative)
<!-- Audience: a developer new to THIS project. Define project-specific terms inline
     on first use; attach roles to named components; keep "shall" phrasing.
     Assumptions & constraints (external deps, explicit out-of-scope): note them here.
     Scope: one capability = one behavior that can fail independently. If you accumulate
     many contract clauses AND many acceptance criteria, you are likely describing several
     capabilities — split them (the linter flags this as 'over-scoped'). -->
- The feature shall ... (one binding, testable behavior per line; "shall" phrasing;
  no function names; true regardless of how the code is implemented).
  <!-- Rationale: why this specific behavior -->
- Output shape + allowed values; required vs optional inputs and how it degrades
  when an optional input is missing/invalid; the decision logic that selects each
  output (say so explicitly if it is delegated to a model/heuristic).

## WHAT — Verify intent (open questions for the human)
- Observed: <a behavior that may be an AI accident — swallowed error, empty-string
  fallback, magic constant, unreachable branch>. Intended, or a bug to fix?

## WHAT — Notes & known limitations (informative)
- A known fragility/footgun the implementer should know but which is NOT enforced.

## HOW — Acceptance (= tests)
<!-- Audience: a developer new to THIS project. Keep Given/When/Then concrete and
     self-explanatory; spell out any term the Contract introduced. -->
AC-1  <!-- verifiable by: automated test | manual | inspection | load test -->
  Given  <precondition>
  When   <action>
  Then   <observable, pass/fail result>   (one test per AC; each maps to tested-by)

## Example — in practice (optional, non-binding)
<!-- A short plain-language story of the feature in use — the angle anyone reads
     to "get it" fast. NON-BINDING illustration: the Given/When/Then above is the
     precise version; on any conflict the Contract + Acceptance win. This section is
     not hashed and not linted, so it never trips drift. -->
- e.g. Ana marks AUTH-001 confirmed, later edits its contract text; at commit
  `check` tells her "DRIFT — contract changed since lock" so she re-reviews.

## WHERE — Current implementation
- How the code does it today (the volatile narrative — may drift from the contract).

## Links
- Used by: (auto)
## Members in code (auto)
